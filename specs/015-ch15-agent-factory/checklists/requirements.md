**Sections**: 10 content sections + front matter + glossary

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`.
- This is the capstone chapter — it MUST feel like a natural culmination, not new content. Every idea should connect back to earlier chapters.
- The "Complete Picture" diagram (CR-002) is the single most important visual in the entire book — it shows how everything fits together.
- The 90-day plan (CR-005) is the chapter's most actionable element — it converts understanding into implementation.
- Four new roles give readers career direction beyond "use AI at work" — aspirational and practical.
- The closing statement (CR-012) is the last thing readers see. It must be powerful, motivational, and grounded in reality.
- Chapter content file: `docs/part-2-ai-systems/ch15-agent-factory.md`
- Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED — ready for author review — **ALL 15 CHAPTERS COMPLETE**
