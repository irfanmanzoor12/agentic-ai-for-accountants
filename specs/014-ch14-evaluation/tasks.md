## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] **T001** — Create chapter file (sidebar_position: 14)
- [ ] **T002** [P] — Add section headings

  - Definition, building guide, 3 sample test cases
  - Scoring mechanics + "Is 94% enough? YOU decide"
  - CRITICAL: keep separate from AI memory
  - **Acceptance**: Reader can build a Golden Dataset immediately after reading

**Checkpoint**: P1 complete — quality controller has the core tool.

---

## Phase 3: Four Dimensions (comprehensive evaluation)

- [ ] **T005** — Write Dimensions 1 + 2: Accuracy + Completeness (350–450 words)
  - Each: what it measures, how to measure, what passing looks like

## Phase 4: Scorecard + Trust Connection

- [ ] **T007** — Write Section 4: AI Evaluation Scorecard Template (400–500 words)
  - Full template — all 4 dimensions, PASS/FAIL, overall assessment
  - **Acceptance**: Reader can fill this in for any evaluated workflow

- [ ] **T008** [P] — Write Section 5: Evaluation → Trust Ladder (250–350 words)
  - Results → which mode to use
  - Every step up requires passing evaluation

---

## Phase 5: Dataset Quality + Calendar

- [ ] **T009** [P] — Write Section 6: Building Good Golden Datasets (300–400 words)
  - 70/20/10 coverage, annual review, separate from memory

- [ ] **T010** [P] — Write Section 7: Evaluation Calendar (200–300 words)
  - Sample calendar format

---

## Phase 6: Exercises + Close

- [ ] **T011** — Write Exercise 1: Mini Golden Dataset + Scorecard (200 words)
- [ ] **T012** [P] — Write Exercise 2: Evaluation Calendar (200 words)
- [ ] **T013** [P] — Write Takeaways + Ch15 Preview + Glossary (450 combined)

---

## Phase 7: Assembly + QC

- [ ] **T014** — Assemble; add transitions
- [ ] **T015** [P] — Verify: Dimension 4 (Professional Judgment) called out as most important
- [ ] **T016** [P] — Verify: Scorecard is complete with PASS/FAIL for all 4 dimensions
- [ ] **T017** [P] — Word count: target 3,200–4,100
