# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 2 — Prompt Engineering for Accountants

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Feature**: [specs/002-ch2-prompt-engineering/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All content requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Reader scenarios cover primary flows (first-timer, casual user, template builder)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] Principle I — Accountant-First: All content understandable without Googling
- [x] Principle II — Domain Authenticity: All examples from audit/tax/bookkeeping (classification, working papers, computations)
- [x] Principle III — Supervisor Mindset: Positions prompting as communication skill for AI supervision
- [x] Principle IV — Concept Over Implementation: No code, no terminal commands, natural language only
- [x] Principle V — Verification as Professional Duty: AI Verification Checklist introduced (CR-007)
- [x] Principle VI — Progressive Complexity: Builds on Ch1 foundation, bridges to Ch3 context engineering
- [x] Principle VII — Spec-Driven Development: Chapter spec written before content
- [x] Principle VIII — Bilingual Accessibility: Roman Urdu glossary required (CR-010)

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers — all requirements have reasonable defaults.
- Chapter bridges between Ch1 (motivation) and Ch3 (strategy) with explicit transition statements (CR-001, CR-013).
- Verification Checklist introduced here becomes a recurring element in all subsequent chapters.
