# Content Plan: Chapter 10 — Guardrails & Safety: Setting Boundaries for Your Digital Team

**Branch**: `010-ch10-guardrails-safety` | **Date**: 2026-02-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

Chapter 10 answers: "How do I keep my digital team within professional and legal boundaries?" The chapter's strength is the instant recognition moment — accountants already live with guardrails (internal controls, authorization matrices, segregation of duties). AI guardrails are the same concept digitally applied. Five categories cover the full spectrum. Core deliverables: Data Classification Matrix, 5 guardrail categories, Guardrails Specification Template, "Newspaper Test." Target: 3,500–4,500 words.

## Content Context

**Format**: Markdown (MDX-compatible)
**Target Length**: 3,500–4,500 words
**Prerequisite**: Ch9 (orchestration — now we add safety boundaries to those workflows)
**Key Deliverables**: 5 guardrail categories, Data Classification Matrix, "Newspaper Test," Guardrails Specification Template

## Constitution Check

- [x] I — Guardrails = internal controls (terminology accountants use daily)
- [x] II — FBR filing rules, ICAP/ACCA ethics, IFRS compliance, CNIC/NTN protection
- [x] III — Accountant sets all rules; AI follows them
- [x] IV — No configuration files, no technical settings — compliance vocabulary
- [x] V — Guardrails are FIRST line of defence; professional verification remains ultimate
- [x] VI — Orchestration (Ch9) → add boundaries (Ch10) → add approval gates (Ch11)
- [x] VII — Plan written before content
- [x] VIII — Roman Urdu glossary
