# Content Plan: Chapter 12 — Memory: When AI Remembers Your Clients

**Branch**: `012-ch12-memory` | **Date**: 2026-02-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

Chapter 12 solves the "brilliant team member with amnesia" problem — AI that forgets everything when the session ends. Three memory types mapped to client file cabinet analogy. The Client Memory Profile Template is the chapter's most practical deliverable — readers can build one during the exercise and use it immediately. Memory security connects directly to Ch10's Data Classification Matrix. Target: 3,000–4,000 words.
