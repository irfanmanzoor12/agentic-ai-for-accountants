## Response snapshot

Created Chapter 15 specification "The Agent Factory: Your Future Role" — the capstone chapter. Synthesizes all 14 chapters into the complete Agent Factory vision. Four new roles: AI Supervisor (direct and oversee), Prompt Architect (design and instruct), Workflow Designer (map and orchestrate), AI Quality Auditor (evaluate and ensure). Includes "Complete Picture" connecting all chapters, Skills Matrix mapping roles to chapters, Digital FTE economics in PKR, Pakistan competitive landscape, and 90-Day AI Adoption Plan (Month 1: Foundations, Month 2: Systems, Month 3: Scale). Powerful closing statement. 3 reader journeys, 12 content requirements, 7 success criteria. All checklist items pass.

## Outcome

- Impact: ALL 15 chapter specifications complete — the entire book is specified and ready for planning
- Tests: Quality checklist — all items pass
- Files: spec.md, checklists/requirements.md
- Next prompts: /sp.plan for any chapter (recommended: start with Ch1 or Ch2)
- Reflection: The 15 specs form a complete, progressive curriculum from "What is AI?" to "Transform your practice." Every chapter builds on the previous. The Agent Factory thesis bookends the book (Ch1 opens with the vision, Ch15 closes with the reader ready to implement it).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist PASS, Constitution compliance PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Move to /sp.plan for individual chapters — starting with Ch1 to establish the content architecture pattern
