## Prompt

lets continue with chapter 1 spec

## Response snapshot

Created the Chapter 1 specification for "Why AI Changes Accounting Forever" — the opening chapter of "Agentic AI for Accounting Professionals." The spec defines 3 reader journeys (Skeptic P1, Curious P2, Manager P3), 13 content requirements covering the SaaSpocalypse hook, SaaS-to-Agent paradigm shift, Digital FTE concept, Intent-Factory-Outcome model, Supervisor Mindset, AI Maturity Levels, hands-on exercises, and Roman Urdu glossary. Includes 7 measurable success criteria, 6 key entities, 4 edge cases, 5 assumptions, and a 12-section chapter outline. Quality checklist created and validated — all items pass including constitution compliance.

## Outcome

- Impact: Chapter 1 spec complete — defines the opening chapter that establishes urgency and sets the tone for the entire book
- Tests: Quality checklist at checklists/requirements.md — all items pass
- Files: spec.md (specification), checklists/requirements.md (validation)
- Next prompts: /sp.plan for Chapter 1 technical plan, OR /sp.specify for Chapter 2
- Reflection: No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers needed — all requirements had reasonable defaults from constitution and prior planning

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None — spec template adapted well for book chapter format
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist PASS (all items), Constitution compliance PASS (all 8 principles)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test spec with /sp.plan to verify it provides enough detail for chapter planning
