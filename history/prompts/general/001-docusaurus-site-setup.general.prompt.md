## Prompt

set up the Docusaurus site

## Response snapshot

Explored project — Docusaurus NOT initialized, all 15 chapters present in docs/. Created the following files: (1) package.json — Docusaurus ^3.0.0 preset-classic, React 18, TypeScript devDependencies; (2) docusaurus.config.ts — docs-only mode (routeBasePath: '/'), blog disabled, title "Agentic AI for Accounting Professionals", tagline, professional blue brand colour, footer with chapter links, markdown.format: 'detect' to treat .md as CommonMark not MDX; (3) sidebars.ts — autogenerated from docs/ directory (sidebar_position front matter drives order); (4) tsconfig.json — extends @docusaurus/tsconfig; (5) src/css/custom.css — professional blue theme, clean table styling; (6) static/.nojekyll — GitHub Pages support; (7) .gitignore — node_modules, build, .docusaurus; (8) .mcp.json — Context7 MCP server (npx @upstash/context7-mcp); (9) docs/intro.md — book landing page with slug: / (homepage), Part 1 + Part 2 overview, links to Ch1; (10) docs/part-1-personal-skills/_category_.json — "Part 1: Your Personal AI Skills", position 1, generated-index link; (11) docs/part-2-ai-systems/_category_.json — "Part 2: Your Digital AI Team", position 2, generated-index link. Ran npm install (1289 packages). First build failed: MDX compiled ch05 as JSX and `<80%` in table was parsed as JSX tag. Fix: replaced `<80%` with `&lt;80%` in ch05 line 304; added `markdown: { format: 'detect' }` to docusaurus.config.ts. Second build: SUCCESS — exit code 0, all 15 chapters + intro compiled successfully.

## Outcome

- Impact: Docusaurus 3.x site initialized and building successfully — all 15 chapters rendering, two-part navigation structure configured
- Tests: npm run build — PASS (exit code 0, "Generated static files in build")
- Files: package.json, docusaurus.config.ts, sidebars.ts, tsconfig.json, src/css/custom.css, static/.nojekyll, .gitignore, .mcp.json, docs/intro.md, docs/part-1-personal-skills/_category_.json, docs/part-2-ai-systems/_category_.json
- Next prompts: Create GitHub repository, push code, configure GitHub Pages deployment
- Reflection: The critical MDX issue — `<80%` parsed as JSX tag — is a common gotcha for content authors who use `<` in prose. The `markdown: { format: 'detect' }` config setting in Docusaurus 3.x makes `.md` files use CommonMark instead of MDX, preventing this class of error for all future chapters. The Context7 MCP is now active at project level via `.mcp.json` — it will provide up-to-date Docusaurus docs when needed for site customization.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: MDX parsing of `<80%` as JSX tag in ch05-test-driven-verification.md line 304. Root cause: Docusaurus 3.x treats .md files as MDX by default unless `markdown.format: 'detect'` is set.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): npm run build — PASS on second attempt after MDX fix
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): When GitHub repo is created, configure GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on push to main branch.
