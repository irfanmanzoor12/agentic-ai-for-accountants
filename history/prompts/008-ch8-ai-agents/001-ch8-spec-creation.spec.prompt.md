## Prompt

yes continue

## Response snapshot

Created Chapter 8 specification "AI Agents: Your Digital Accounting Team" — the synthesis chapter where all prior concepts unify. Includes the Anatomy of an AI Agent (6 components mapped to Ch1-7), Digital FTE concept (168 hrs/week), 3 named agent profiles in Roman Urdu: Hisaab (bookkeeping), Mehsool (tax), Jaiza (audit) — each with "day in the life" workflows and human touchpoints. Three Paths framework (General/Custom/Pre-built), agent economics in PKR, Principal-Performer supervisor relationship. 3 reader journeys, 11 content requirements, 7 success criteria. All checklist items pass.

## Outcome

- Impact: Synthesis chapter complete — readers now have a unified mental model of AI agents
- Tests: Quality checklist — all items pass
- Files: spec.md, checklists/requirements.md
- Next prompts: /sp.specify for Chapter 9 (Orchestration & Multi-Agent Workflows)
- Reflection: Roman Urdu agent names (Hisaab, Mehsool, Jaiza) add strong cultural resonance. The Anatomy table connecting all 6 prior chapters is the most important visual in the book.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist PASS, Constitution compliance PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ch9 should show how the 3 named agents work TOGETHER — orchestration of Hisaab + Mehsool + Jaiza
