# Chapter 7: AI Skills — What Agents Can Do

> *"MCP gives AI the roads. Skills are the vehicles that travel on them."*

Chapter 6 showed you how AI connects to your tools — the bank feed, the accounting software, the tax database. MCP is the infrastructure: the connection standard that lets AI reach the real world. But connection alone accomplishes nothing. What matters is what AI can DO with that connection.

This chapter answers the question every accountant asks once they understand AI conceptually: "What EXACTLY can AI do in my practice?" Not vague promises. Not general statements about automation. Specific, named capabilities that map to your daily task list.

The answer is a catalogue of 15 accounting AI skills. Each one is a task you recognise. Each one has a defined input, a defined output, and a clear boundary where your professional judgment takes over.

## What Is an AI Skill?

When your firm hires a new junior accountant, you write a job description. It lists specific tasks: "Perform bank reconciliations. Prepare accrual entries. Draft working papers." Each item on that list is a discrete, bounded capability — one thing the employee does reliably, given the right inputs.

An AI skill is exactly that. It is one specific task that AI can perform reliably, given defined inputs, producing defined outputs. Not "help with accounting." Not "assist with your practice." One task. Clear in. Clear out.

Think of it this way:

| Element | Human Job Description | AI Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Name | "Prepare bank reconciliation" | Reconcile |
| Input | Bank statement + ledger | Bank data + ledger data |
| Output | Reconciled trial balance + exceptions | Matched items + exception list |
| Quality standard | 98% accuracy, differences explained | All differences flagged for review |
| Human oversight | Manager reviews before sign-off | You review before posting |

The difference between a prompt (Chapters 2–3) and a skill is important. A prompt is something you type into a chat. A skill is a capability built into an AI system — it runs automatically, consistently, every time, without you typing anything. Skills use prompts internally, but you never see them. You only see the output.

## The Accounting AI Skills Catalogue

Here are 15 AI skills organised by accounting practice area. These are capabilities that exist today or are emerging in the immediate term. For each skill, you will see what AI does, what it needs, and where your professional oversight is required.

## Skills vs. Professional Judgment — The Boundary

Every skill has two sides. One side is what AI can handle systematically. The other side is where your professional expertise is irreplaceable.

Understanding this boundary is not about limiting AI. It is about deploying AI correctly — giving it the work it can do reliably, while keeping for yourself the work that requires your training, experience, and professional accountability.

| AI Skill (Reliable, Rule-Based) | Professional Judgment (Human Only) |
|---|---|
| Classify transactions by pattern and description | Determine if a classification reflects the economic substance of an unusual transaction |
| Calculate depreciation using specified rates and method | Choose the most appropriate depreciation method for a new class of asset |
| Compute tax liability using current Finance Act rates | Advise on a tax planning position with legal uncertainty |
| Perform analytical procedures and flag movements | Assess whether a flagged movement represents a genuine misstatement risk |
| Draft audit working paper structure | Form an audit conclusion based on the evidence gathered |
| Reconcile accounts and present exceptions | Investigate whether an unexplained difference is an error or a timing item |
| Generate financial report from approved trial balance | Interpret financial results and advise management on implications |

The pattern is consistent: AI handles the procedure. You handle the interpretation, the judgment, and the conclusion. This division is not a limitation — it is a feature. It means AI removes the procedural burden so your professional time focuses entirely on the part that matters most.

---

### Advisory Skills

| Skill | What AI Does | Input Required | Output Produced | Your Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Summarize** | Compresses lengthy financial documents, reports, or regulatory material into structured key-point summaries | Full document (financial statements, audit report, regulatory guidance) | Structured summary with key figures, findings, or provisions | Review for accuracy; ensure no material point was omitted or misrepresented |

The advisory category will grow as AI capabilities expand. Summarize is included here because it cross-cuts all practice areas — every accountant compresses long documents into key points for clients, management, or regulators. This is a universal bookkeeping, tax, and audit task that AI can handle at Level 2 maturity today.

## Composability — The LEGO Analogy

A single LEGO brick is useful. It can support something, mark a location, hold a space. But when you start connecting bricks, something different emerges — structures, systems, models. The power of LEGO is not in individual bricks. It is in what you can build when you combine them.

AI skills work the same way.

Each skill does one thing reliably. But skills become genuinely powerful when you compose them into workflows — one skill's output becoming the next skill's input. Here are two examples from everyday accounting practice:

**Monthly Closing Workflow:**

```
Classify → Reconcile → Accrue → Depreciate → Report
    ↓           ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
Transactions  Matches   Accruals   Depr.    Financial
classified   confirmed  approved  posted    statements
```

Each step is a skill. The output of one feeds the input of the next. At each stage, you review and approve before proceeding. The result: a month-end close that previously took two days of data work is reduced to a series of review decisions — the part that requires your professional judgment.

**Quarterly Tax Filing Workflow:**

```
Research → Compute → Plan → Draft Return
    ↓          ↓        ↓          ↓
Current     Tax      Planning  Return data
rates      liability  options   for review
confirmed  calculated reviewed  and filing
```

Four skills, one workflow. AI handles the procedure at each stage. You make the professional decisions: is this planning strategy appropriate for this client? Does this liability figure look correct? Are there any items that require FBR-specialist judgment?

You do not need to build these workflows yourself. In Chapters 8 and 9, you will learn about the agents and orchestration systems that assemble skills into running workflows. What you need to understand now is the principle: skills are composable, workflows are built from skills, and the accountant's role is to supervise the workflow, not perform the steps.

**Why composability matters more than any single skill:**

A single Classify skill saves you perhaps 30 minutes of transaction coding per week. Useful. But a composed Classify + Reconcile + Report workflow — running every morning before you arrive — transforms how your entire month-end close operates. The value of AI does not come from automating one task. It comes from chaining tasks into self-running workflows that deliver ready-to-review outputs. Composability is where accounting AI shifts from convenient to transformative.

This also explains why the skills catalogue in this chapter matters as a reading exercise, not just a reference. When you see "Classify," you should be thinking: "What feeds into Classify? What does Classify feed into?" Map the dependencies. Identify the natural chains. Those chains are the workflows you will build — or supervise being built — using the agents in Chapter 8.

## How Skills Connect to What You Have Already Learned

Every concept from the previous chapters plays a role in how skills work:

| Chapter Concept | Role in AI Skills |
|---|---|
| **Ch3 — Context** | Skills receive your context document as their background knowledge — your firm's policies, applicable standards, chart of accounts structure |
| **Ch4 — Spec** | The Skills Requirement Template (below) is how you write a spec for a skill — inputs, outputs, constraints, acceptance criteria |
| **Ch5 — Verification** | Every skill produces output that requires verification against the Golden Dataset and the 7-Point Checklist |
| **Ch6 — MCP** | Skills use MCP connections to access the data they need and post outputs to your accounting tools |

You have not been learning isolated concepts. You have been building the framework that makes AI skills work in professional practice.

## Skill Maturity Levels

Not all skills operate at the same level of autonomy. The same skill can operate in three different modes depending on how much you trust AI's performance on that specific task and how much professional judgment the task requires.

| Maturity Level | What AI Does | Your Role | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1 — Assist** | AI suggests or prepares options; you do the final work | You make all decisions; AI is a reference tool | New skill, unfamiliar task type, or high-judgment content |
| **Level 2 — Draft** | AI produces a complete first draft; you review and finalise | Review output, make corrections, approve | AI has demonstrated accuracy; you verify before use |
| **Level 3 — Execute** | AI performs the task end-to-end within defined guardrails; you review the summary | Review flagged exceptions; spot-check periodically | AI has an extensive accuracy track record on this specific task |

Not every skill reaches Level 3 — and that is the right outcome. A skill like "Draft WP" (audit working paper) may appropriately stay at Level 2 forever: AI produces the structure, you add the professional conclusions. A skill like "Classify transactions" may reach Level 3 after months of verified performance — AI classifies, you review the exceptions it flags.

The Trust Ladder from Chapter 5 (Verify-Then-Trust Progression) determines which level is appropriate for each skill, at each stage of your AI journey.

## The Skills Requirement Template

Before an AI vendor, an IT team, or an AI agent platform can build a skill for your practice, you need to define what the skill must do. This template is the tool for that definition — it is the job description for a specific AI capability.

---

**AI SKILL REQUIREMENT**

```

When you hand this document to a vendor or IT team, they know exactly what to build. When you evaluate an AI tool that claims to have this skill, you have a checklist to test against. The Skills Requirement is the Chapter 4 AI Task Specification applied to a reusable AI capability rather than a one-time task.

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Skills Audit — Map Your Practice to the Catalogue

**Time:** 25 minutes

Review the 15 skills in the catalogue above. For each skill that applies to your practice area, complete this assessment:

| Skill | Relevant to My Work? | Currently Done Manually? | AI-Ready Now? | Target Maturity Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classify | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No | Assist / Draft / Execute |
| Reconcile | | | | |
| Accrue | | | | |
| [Continue for relevant skills...] | | | | |

Once you have assessed all relevant skills, identify:
- Your **top 3 "ready now"** skills — tasks that are manual, repetitive, and rule-based, where AI could assist immediately
- Your **top 1 "not yet"** skill — a task important to your practice that AI is not ready for today, and why

This assessment becomes your starting point for deciding where to invest in AI skills first.

---

### Exercise 2: Write a Skills Requirement

**Time:** 20 minutes

From your Exercise 1 list, pick your highest-priority "ready now" skill. Write a complete Skills Requirement using the template above. Fill in all fields — do not leave any blank.

Focus especially on:
- **Quality Criteria** — if you do not know what "correct" looks like for this task, AI cannot be evaluated
- **Human Review Points** — be honest about where professional judgment is genuinely needed
- **Exception Handling** — what should AI flag for you rather than handle automatically?

When complete, ask yourself: if you sent this document to an AI vendor and they built exactly what you described, would you trust the output? If no — revise the quality criteria and human review points until yes.

## Key Takeaways

1. **An AI skill is one task on a job description — specific inputs, defined outputs, clear quality criteria.** It is not a general capability. It is a bounded, repeatable task.

2. **Fifteen skills cover most of what accountants do.** Classify, Reconcile, Accrue, Depreciate, Report (bookkeeping); Compute, Research, Plan, Draft Return (tax); Analyze, Sample, Draft WP, Draft Letter, Risk Assess (audit); Summarize (advisory).

3. **Skills are composable.** Monthly closing is Classify + Reconcile + Accrue + Depreciate + Report, chained in sequence. Tax filing is Research + Compute + Plan + Draft Return. The workflow is built from skills.

4. **Every skill has a judgment boundary.** AI handles procedure. You handle interpretation, conclusion, and professional sign-off. This division is what makes AI safe for professional work.

5. **Skills mature from Assist to Draft to Execute.** Not all skills reach Level 3, and that is correct. High-judgment skills stay at Level 2; pattern-based skills can advance to Level 3 after demonstrating accuracy.

6. **Write a Skills Requirement before implementing any skill.** It is the job description that prevents misunderstanding, defines quality, and gives you the test criteria you need.

> **Chapter 8 preview:** Skills are what agents DO. Chapter 8 introduces the agents — Hisaab, Mehsool, and Jaiza — the specialised digital employees who combine skills, context, and MCP connections into a complete working unit.
