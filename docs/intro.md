# Agentic AI for Accounting Professionals

**From ChatGPT to AI Supervisors — A Non-Programmer's Guide**

---

This book is for accountants — auditors, tax specialists, bookkeepers, and advisory professionals — who want to use AI as more than a chatbot.

By the end of this book, you will know how to **direct a team of AI agents** that handles your routine work while you focus on professional judgment, client relationships, and high-value analysis. No programming required. No technical background assumed.

## What You Will Learn

**Part 1: Your Personal AI Skills** (Chapters 1–5) gives you the foundation:

- Why AI changes the accounting profession — and why accountants become supervisors, not programmers
- How to write prompts that produce professional, accurate output every time
- How to give AI the complete context it needs for complex accounting tasks
- How to specify tasks clearly before AI executes them
- How to verify AI output with professional rigor

**Part 2: Your Digital AI Team** (Chapters 6–15) builds your team:

- How AI connects to your accounting tools (MCP)
- What specific accounting tasks AI can perform (Skills)
- What an AI agent is and how it works as a digital employee (Agents)
- How multiple agents work together on complex workflows (Orchestration)
- How to set rules and limits that keep AI within professional boundaries (Guardrails)
- How to supervise AI at exactly the right level (Human-in-the-Loop)
- How AI remembers your clients across sessions (Memory)
- How AI looks up your firm's standards and past work (RAG)
- How to measure whether AI output meets professional standards (Evaluation)
- Your future role as an AI Supervisor in the Agent Factory model (Chapter 15)

## Who This Book Is For

Any accounting professional — ACCA, CA, CPA, tax practitioner, bookkeeper — who wants to:

- Use AI effectively and safely in client work
- Understand what AI can and cannot do for accounting
- Lead AI adoption at their firm rather than follow it
- Build a career at the intersection of accounting and AI

## Core Principle

> Accountants don't become programmers. Accountants become AI supervisors.

Every chapter reinforces this principle. You define what "correct" means. AI cannot exercise professional judgment. Your expertise and professional authority remain irreplaceable — AI multiplies the capacity you bring to the work.
